I should do gmm just with the diagonal fit where covariance is a diagonal matrix. non-diagonal matrix would rrecure some adjustment of average and variance. 

non-diagonal aka full gmm would get the patterns between then features. we can do that also with random forest. we can cut down on calculation cost by using a few trees.

regression, however, would decrease the variance and result in overfitting. we need to use gmm to sample again.


an appropriate method would be to do gmm, rf then gmm again and may be repeate a few times.

since mean stays the same, with gmm, it doesn't mater to get more complicated in that direction.


as a check for convergence of imputed value, look at max-min of the means

done solving a problem to impute for the whole set.

looked at the change in the mean. it's a random walk. the conclusion is to use gmm just to randomize the mean.
