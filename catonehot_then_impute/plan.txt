+ change Z to NA
+ add var4 root as another column. 
+ take the column out of train and predict data (td and pd).
+ skip missing values.
+ train one hot on it.
+ remember the locations of missing values in pd.
+ imput the nanas with median or first non-nan variable or "A".
+ transform with onehot.
+ put the missing values back in.
+ save the feature_indecies_.
+ put the transformed columns back. do for all columns. -->  i just return the new columns
+ check the previous
+ one hot while keeping NaN. skip var4 parent, save feature_indices_ so that we can add the parent later
+ separate onehot out from imputing.

- prepare data
- do cross validation and submission on the oh data.

- use different ways of imputing

- reduce number of features

- reduce number of rows

- do stacking

- optimize models
